# Elevate-Labs-Task-8

The objective of this task was to create a basic interactive dashboard using a visualization tool (Power BI or Tableau) that shows sales performance. The tool I used was Tableau and the dataset I worked on is Sales.xlsx which is attached to this repository. I imported the Excel workbook into Tableau and then created various worksheets containing different charts that highlighted the relationship between revenue, profit and the months of the year. I also created three KPIs to display the total revenue, total cost and total profit. After which, I created my dashboard using horizontal and vertical containers to place my visuals. I added filters on all charts for aid interactivity. The insights derived from these visuals are on the Insights.txt file attached to this repository along with a screenshot of the dashboard.
